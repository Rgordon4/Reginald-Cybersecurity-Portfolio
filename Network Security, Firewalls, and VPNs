### Nmap Scan Example
Used to identify open ports and services on target host.

### Wireshark Packet Capture
Captured traffic during simulated attack scenario.

## 🧠 Observations
- Nmap revealed SSH and HTTP services on target
- Wireshark showed suspicious ICMP traffic
- Nessus flagged outdated Apache version

## 📚 Lessons Learned
- Importance of layered scanning tools
- Real-time packet analysis is critical for threat detection
