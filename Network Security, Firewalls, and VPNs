## 🔍 Overview
This section documents the tools used to assess network security posture, including scanning, enumeration, and vulnerability detection.

## 🛠️ Tools Covered
- ARP
- Ip/ifconfig
- Hping3
- Ping
- TCPDump
- Nmap/Zenmap
- Wireshark

## 📸 Lab Screenshots & Results

### Nmap Scan Example
Used to identify open ports and services on target host.

## 🧠 Observations
- Nmap revealed SSH and HTTP services on target
- Wireshark showed suspicious ICMP traffic
- Nessus flagged outdated Apache version

## 📚 Lessons Learned
- Importance of layered scanning tools
- Real-time packet analysis is critical for threat detection
