# 🌐 VPN Configuration Walkthrough

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates how to configure a secure Virtual Private Network (VPN) using **pfSense** and **OpenVPN**. It covers firewall rule setup, certificate-based authentication, and encrypted traffic validation using **Wireshark**. The goal is to simulate a secure remote access environment suitable for enterprise use.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **pfSense** (Firewall & VPN Gateway)
- **OpenVPN** (VPN Protocol)
- **Wireshark** (Packet Analysis)
- **Kali Linux** (Optional for testing)
- **VirtualBox / VMware** (Lab virtualization)

## 🛠️ Lab Setup
1. **Deploy pfSense** on a virtual machine with WAN/LAN interfaces.
2. **Configure OpenVPN Server**:
   - Generate CA and server certificates
   - Set up user authentication
   - Export client configuration
3. **Firewall Rules**:
   - Allow UDP 1194 on WAN
   - Create NAT and LAN pass rules
4. **Client Setup**:
   - Import `.ovpn` config into OpenVPN client
   - Connect and verify tunnel status

## 🔍 Traffic Validation
Used **Wireshark** to inspect VPN traffic:
- Confirmed encrypted packets over UDP
- Verified IP masking and DNS leak protection
- Ensured handshake and TLS negotiation were successful

## 📸 Screenshots

## 🧠 Key Concepts Demonstrated
- VPN tunneling and encryption
- Certificate-based authentication
- Firewall rule logic and NAT
- Packet inspection for security validation

## 🧪 Challenges & Solutions
| Issue | Resolution |
|------|------------|
| Tunnel failed to establish | Corrected firewall rule to allow UDP 1194 |
| DNS leaks detected | Enabled DNS override in OpenVPN settings |
| Certificate mismatch | Regenerated client cert with correct CN |
