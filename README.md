# 👨‍💻 Reginald | Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio—a space where technical precision meets real-world impact. I'm currently completing the Cybersecurity CSC at J. Sargent Reynolds, with hands-on experience in Linux system administration, network security, forensic analysis, and ethical hacking.

## 🔐 About Me
I'm a methodical problem-solver with a background in logistics and a specialist in dangerous goods. As I transition into cybersecurity, I bring a sharp eye for risk, a passion for digital forensics, and a commitment to building secure systems that stand up to real threats.

Whether I'm configuring firewalls, analyzing packet captures, or drafting service models for a future consulting business, I approach every challenge with persistence, curiosity, and strategic intent.

## 🧪 Featured Projects
- **VPN Configuration Walkthrough**  
  Setup and validation of OpenVPN on pfSense, including encrypted traffic analysis with Wireshark.

- **Linux Hardening Lab** *(coming soon)*  
  Step-by-step guide to securing a Debian-based system using CIS benchmarks and audit tools.

- **SIEM & Log Analysis** *(coming soon)*  
  Simulated SOC workflow using Splunk and Elastic Stack to detect and respond to network anomalies.

## 🎯 Current Goals
- Earn **Security+** and prepare for **CySA+**
- Build out a full portfolio of walkthroughs and labs
- Gain hands-on experience in SOC or security operations
- Launch a cybersecurity consulting business post-retirement

## 🌍 Beyond the Terminal
I’m also planning a solo retirement trip to Rio de Janeiro—seeking cultural immersion, meaningful connection, and celebration of a new chapter. I believe in living with intention, whether it’s securing a network or exploring the world.
